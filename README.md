# Linear_Regression_py
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modeling the relationship between a scalar dependent variable y and one or more explanatory variables (or independent variables) denoted X. The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression. For more than one explanatory variable, the process is called multiple linear regression. (source-wikipedia)
so in my code we can use simple linear regression as well and multi linear regressiion(but not suggested).
